# Quark-membership-ros-roadmap
--- 

This roadmap is designed to take you from a beginner to a confident ROS 2 developer over 12 weeks. The program combines theoretical concepts with extensive hands-on practice, using tools like Turtlesim, Gazebo, and RViz 2 to simulate and visualize real-world robotics applications.

Each session includes:

Quizzes to reinforce key concepts.
Q&A Discussions to clarify doubts and deepen understanding.
By the end of the program, you will have a strong foundation in ROS 2, control systems, sensor integration, and simulation tools, preparing you for practical robotics projects and applications.

Here’s a refined version of your **Quark Membership ROS 2 Roadmap**. The improvements focus on balancing theory and hands-on work, adding milestone evaluations, expanding practical examples, and ensuring smooth progression:
